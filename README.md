## Getting Started

So long as you have this project open in a terminal with node installed:
- run npm install to get all necessary dependencies
- run npm run start to open a local instance

This application uses spotify's OAuthv2 enabled API and will consume some private data, such as:
- Music listening history
- Spotify Profile details (name, email, etc.)
- And some other random metadata

I guarantee you I do not intend to do anything with your data, this was just a fun side project for me to learn OAuth and play with Graph.js
